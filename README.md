TeamRank
========

A website for tracking tournament statistics for osu!

The main purpose of this site is to collect as much data as possible about tournaments, so that it is possible to tweak algorithms and still be able to run it on a full dataset.

The algorithm in question will initially be based on Elo, although since Elo is obviously not fit for a team ranking system, it will undergo much changes with feedback from the community.
